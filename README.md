# MTsatMP2RAGE

**MATLAB code for calculating T1 maps as in the manuscript, and running simmulations.**

## Requirements:

- Requires the qMRlab toolbox (http://qmrlab.org/) which can be downloaded here: https://github.com/qMRLab/qMRLab
- Uses the following simulation code: https://github.com/TardifLab/OptimizeIHMTimaging
- The simulations for B1 correction are based on the following toolbox and manuscript, but the above link contains the most updated functions, so use those! https://github.com/TardifLab/MTsatB1correction
- Assumes an MP2RAGE is used for T1 mapping, and thus for the noise calculations. So we need the MP2RAGE code from: https://github.com/JosePMarques/MP2RAGE-related-scripts
- Contains some misc code such as colormaps, and the necessary MP2RAGE code for correcting M0 https://github.com/christopherrowley/NeuroImagingMatlab
  - Specificalling in /QuantitativeFitting/MP2RAGE-related-scripts-master/Rowley_custom

## Data

Sample data for calculating MTsat with MP2RAGE is provided in /sampleData

- The data is stored as individual matlab matrices, and they have been skull stripped and cropped to reduce data size
- They have been labeled as "input*" or "output*", with the output files to be used as a reference.

Folder b1/ contains the necessary simulation outputs to b1 correct the MTsat data with the model-based approach

## Code Overview:

Code is broken up into sections depending on what you are looking to do.

- **MTeffect_in_T1mapping/** the main scripts for running the simulations, as well as the resulting values were saved. To get the simulations to match up, you will need to modify the qMRlab script for the lineshape, to the value of 1.4e-5 for condition of superLorenztian lineshape and delta = 0.

- **ProcessingScripts/** sample scripts for calculating maps

# The inversion recovery data for the phantom was fit using the qMRlab GUI. I was not able to adapt the code to get it to run outside of that.
