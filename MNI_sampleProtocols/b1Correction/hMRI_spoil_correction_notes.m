%% Notes for creating hMRI spoiling correction:
% 
%  Start Matlab and the SPM (fMRI) user interface: spm fmri,
%  Start the Batch GUI (Batch button in the SPM Menu).
%  Check whether you can access the hMRI toolbox: SPM > Tools > hMRI Tools
%  Select 'Imperfect Spoiling Calc'

% Enter in the values
% You can save the parameters out
% Then press the green play button to run the EPG sims. This may take a
% while. You might only know that they are running as the cursor will
% circle when you move it over the window. Otherwise it might not be
% obvious that matlab is working.
